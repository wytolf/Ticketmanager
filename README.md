This is the final project of the HSLU module “WEBT”, which was implemented in the early semester of the study program. The implementation does not always make sense but the requirements demanded it.

## Task:
Create a web application that meets the framework and requirements below. The basic structure of the web application is predetermined and consists of a client-side part (static HTML document with form) and a server-side part (PHP script that has an effect and creates an HTML document). Figure 1 shows a schematic of the structure and interaction within the web application. The web application must have its own, uniform theme. The implementation of all requirements must be aligned with this theme. The actual content and design of the web application is up to you, but must match the chosen theme.
